# Ultrasonic Alarm System with Arduino

An Arduino-based security system that uses an ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, servo motor, LCD display, and a buzzer to detect objects in real time. The system rotates to provide 180° protection and triggers visual and audio alarms when an object is detected within range.

## 📌 Features
- **Real-time object detection** using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.  
- **180° rotating coverage** with a servo motor for enhanced area protection.  
- **Visual feedback** through multiple LEDs controlled by a 74HC595 shift register.  
- **Audio alerts** with a buzzer when objects are detected in range.  
- **LCD 1602 display** to show distance values and system status.  
- **Adjustable contrast** using a potentiometer with the LCD display.

## 💻 How It Works
1. The **HC-SR04 sensor** sends ultrasonic pulses and measures the time taken for the echo to return.  
2. The Arduino calculates **precise distance values** from the travel time.  
3. The **servo motor rotates up to 180°**, scanning the area.  
4. When an object is detected within the defined range:  
   - The servo motor **stops rotating**.  
   - The **buzzer** sounds an alarm.  
   - **LEDs light up** to indicate detection.  
   - The **LCD display** shows the distance and system status.
