# Ultrasonic Alarm System with Arduino

An Arduino-based security system that uses an ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, servo motor, LCD display, and a buzzer to detect objects in real time. The system rotates to provide 180¬∞ protection and triggers visual and audio alarms when an object is detected within range.

## üìå Features

- **Real-time object detection** using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
- **180¬∞ rotating coverage** with a servo motor for enhanced area protection.
- **Visual feedback** through multiple LEDs controlled by a 74HC595 shift register.
- **Audio alerts** with a buzzer when objects are detected in range.
- **LCD 1602 display** to show distance values and system status.
- **Adjustable contrast** using a potentiometer with the LCD display.

## üíª How It Works

1. The **HC-SR04 sensor** sends ultrasonic pulses and measures the time taken for the echo to return.
2. The Arduino calculates **precise distance values** from the travel time.
3. The **servo motor rotates up to 180¬∞**, scanning the area.
4. When an object is detected within the defined range:
   - The servo motor **stops rotating**.
   - The **buzzer** sounds an alarm.
   - **LEDs light up** to indicate detection.
   - The **LCD display** shows the distance and system status.
